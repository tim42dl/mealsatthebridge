                <h1>a home, </b></h1>
                <h1>a purpose. </b></h1>
                <p> The vision of an Ozmmaus community came about after a visit to a few Emmaus communities in UK.Further research has revealed other successful models at Delancey Street in the US as well as a similar social enterprise called Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles. Ozmmaus is an Australian version of these models.</p>
                <p>Instead of offering homeless people temporary shelter or giving them handouts Ozmmaus seeks to provide a long-term solution - one that restores self-esteem,
                offers hope, care and a future. It will also provide a place to learn, apply new skills and develop a sense of purpose.</p>
                <p>Working not only provides meaningful activity but is also a form of therapy.</p>
                <p>Every resident at Ozmmaus will sign off Centrelink payments to work full-time for the community which aims to become self-supporting through its money making business.</p>
                <p>The residents are involved in all aspects of the business which might include furniture repair and restoration, recycling, gardening and landscaping</p>
                <p>The residents are free to live and work in the community for as long as they need. The ultimate aim, however, is that the men and women of Ozmmaus move on to lead a full and rewarding life outside.</p>
                <p>We need your help: the development of an Ozmmaus community is a long-term goal that in the shorter term requires a massive amount of dedication, hard work and financial support from people who share our vision.</p>
